# Paydown-Debt-Tracker

This project is a back-end program written in Java that collects user-entered debt amounts as a string, converts them into numbers, and stores it in a database. From there, the user can receive an update of their debt amounts, providing insight on how long it will take to pay it off completely. The work is still in progress, with some later goals being to make sure the data pull and update from the SQL server is smooth and without errors, and eventually use an API to connect to bank accounts or financial institutions to get information from there.
